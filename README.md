## How it Works:
The JavaScript code calculates the password strength based on the following criteria:

- Length: Longer passwords are generally more secure.
- Character Variety: The presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters increases strength.
- Complexity: More complex passwords, such as those that avoid common patterns, are stronger.

## Customization:
- CSS: You can customize the appearance of the application by modifying the CSS file (style.css).
- JavaScript: You can enhance the password strength criteria or add more complex validation rules by modifying the JavaScript file (script.js).
